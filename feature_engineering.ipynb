The Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services (CMCS) oversees Medicaid and CHIP, providing health coverage to low-income individuals and families. Medicaid covers low-income people, CHIP provides health coverage for children in families with incomes too high for Medicaid, and BHP offers affordable coverage for those with fluctuating incomes. CMCS manages Medicaid.gov and InsureKidsNow.gov to provide critical information about eligibility, benefits, application processes, and policy updates to millions of users\\nGoal\\nTo modernize CMS’s website infrastructure, enhance security, improve user experience, and ensure compliance with accessibility and federal regulations by upgrading to the latest Drupal versions, implementing Agile and DevSecOps practices, and leveraging cloud technologies for scalability and reliability. This initiative streamlines content deployment, optimize business processes, and maintain the highest standards of security and accessibility for Medicaid, CHIP, and BHP users.\\nChallenge\\nAdministering benefits through Medicaid, CHIP, and BHP is complex and constantly evolving due to policy changes, budget constraints, health crises, outdated technology, and growing user expectations. Sky Solutions leads this website modernization to address these challenges, including outdated infrastructure, security vulnerabilities, inefficient processes, and accessibility issues. The existing Drupal version had limited capabilities, impacting the delivery of updates and features.\\nSolutions\\nTo address these challenges, Sky initiated an organized modernization effort. We tackle the outdated technology stack by migrating to the latest Drupal versions and implementing advanced automation testing such as Playwright for comprehensive testing on the code, for performance and security. Additionally, we introduce an Agile and DevSecOps culture that streamlines business processes therefore facilitating faster development cycles and improved collaboration. We optimize content deployment processes, ensuring the rapid dissemination of up-to-date information. With security being of the utmost importance, Sky implements robust measures to ensure compliance with ATO and FISMA requirements, along with significant infrastructure upgrades that leverage cloud-based solutions on AWS to enhance scalability and reliability and a migration to Google’s Vertex AI Search.\\nSky has embarked on a comprehensive modernization journey targeting various facets critical to transforming the landscape. At the forefront was the cultivation of an Agile and DevSecOps culture, introducing automation that streamlined processes, significantly reducing the time and effort required for new feature delivery and content posting. To fortify compliance and security measures, robust cloud and platform management strategies were implemented. Governance standards were established to ensure adherence to regulations and security requirements, alongside the execution of a meticulously devised cloud strategy for Acquia cloud Drupal version upgrades.\\nAn equally vital focus was the ability to maintain stringent compliance with accessibility standards and regulations. Sky diligently ensures compliance with a spectrum of stringent standards, including U.S. Web Design/DigitalGov, OMB Federal Web Standards, CMS and HHS policies, and W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) standards. Upholding Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act was pivotal, demonstrating a commitment to inclusivity and accessibility for all users.\\nSky engineered a robust CI/CD pipeline, ushering in a DevOps culture and embracing test-driven development methodologies. The integration of security and compliance tools into the CI/CD pipeline ensured proactive identification and resolution of vulnerabilities before deployment, enhancing the overall security posture of the platforms. The maintenance of Mini Orange for single sign-on (SSO) to Drupal sites and the utilization of Akamai for CDN configuration significantly improved user experience and site performance, underlining the commitment to enhancing accessibility and usability.\\nTechnologies/Methodologies\\nDrupal\\nAgile & DevSecOps\\nAWS (Amazon Web Services)\\nGoogle Vertex\\nAcquia Cloud\\nDevSecOps\\nCI/CD Pipeline\\nAccessibility Tools include SiteImprove, ANDI, JAWS, WAVE\\nSecurity Tools compliance with security standards like ATO and FISMA\\nSection 508 Compliance\\nOutcome\\nUltimately, our efforts enabled CMCS to keep pace with the changing health landscape and continue to provide a fast and reliable web presence via Medicaid.gov and IKN platforms, available to the public 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. We accelerate speed-to-market as it relates to ongoing regulatory and benefit changes that need to be communicated and accessible to beneficiaries in a timely manner. We help drive the best consumer and usability experience possible, making it easier and more intuitive for beneficiaries to find and use the information and resources they need. Lastly, we ensure compliance with all security guidelines and accessibility requirements, aligning to CMCS’s aspiration to be a model employer of people with disabilities and provide equally effective access to its programs and services.\\nMillions of users use Medicaid.gov and IKN.gov to find information about these programs.\\n93,008,246 individuals enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP in the 51 states and the District of Columbia reported enrollment data for January 2023.\\nOur technologies are designed to seamlessly integrate with your existing systems, minimizing disruption and maximizing productivity.\\nFollow Us on\\nEmail\\nGo\\nFacebook Icon\\nTwitter Icon\\nLinkedIn Icon\\nYoutube Icon\\nQuick Links\\nHome\\nServices\\nIndustries\\nSky Success\\nAbout Us\\nCareers\\nContact Us\\nOther Links\\nSky Leadership\\nPartners\\nLatest News\\nContract Vehicles\\nCapability Statement\\nLegal\\nData Privacy\\nTerms of Use\\nContact Us\\nCopyright © 2024 Sky Solutions.

The company serves a broad base of wireline and wireless customers across TV, phone, internet, and mobile services, offering a comprehensive range of customer interaction channels to ensure seamless communication. These channels include its website, online chat, mobile apps, social media platforms, email support, and direct communication with customer service representatives via phone.\\nGoal\\nThe client wanted to improve customer service efficiency and the overall experience for its customers by using the Pega platform. By reducing static, repetitive interactions across marketing channels, they sought to improve customer satisfaction while enhancing operational efficiency. Redirecting calls from call centers would result in significant cost savings. Hence, they wanted to implement an intelligent system that would enable the organization to make informed predictions based on cross-channel indicators of customer activity. Cross-channel integration would ensure a consistent and personalized experience for every customer.\\nChallenge\\nThe existing customer service systems were neither integrated nor intelligent, leading to a series of static and disconnected customer interactions. These design flaws resulted in long wait times for customers calling the center, and the lack of personalization often made the experience irrelevant to their specific needs. This, in turn, caused frustration, increased customer turnover, and higher operational costs due to increased human intervention. As customer satisfaction declined and call volumes to the center rose, the company’s bottom-line was directly impacted.\\nSolutions\\nSky Solutions implemented an intelligent interactive voice response (IVR) system tailored to each customer’s attributes and interaction history. By capturing and analyzing customer feedback, the system continuously refined its decision-making process, ensuring the most relevant IVR prompts were presented.\\nTo further enhance the customer experience, the system also made on-hold messaging dynamic. Messages played during the IVR phase were no longer repeated while the customer waited, creating a more engaging and seamless experience.\\nA centralized decision hub was developed to guide the next best action for each customer, maintaining a personalized experience even during the hold period. This hub generated up to five potential IVR intents and three hold message options, ensuring the interaction felt relevant and timely.\\nIn addition to the phone channel, the solution was expanded to other customer touchpoints, including the mobile app and website, making it truly omni-channel. The decision hub was built using Pega’s Customer Decision Hub, enabling adaptive models that learn from customer responses, balancing the need to improve customer satisfaction with the business goals of increasing sales and reducing costs.\\nTechnologies/Methodologies\\nLow-code development\\nAgile methodologies\\nDigital Process Automation (DPA)\\nPega\\nOutcome\\nReduced on-call time:\\nBy utilizing intelligently determined customer engagement intents, on-call time was significantly reduced, streamlining interactions.\\nCost savings:\\nThe solution reduced the number of calls handled by customer service agents, leading to nearly $7 million in savings within the first seven months of deployment.\\nUnified cross-channel experience:\\nThe solution was successfully extended to both wireline and wireless domains, creating a seamless experience across all customer touchpoints.\\nImproved customer satisfaction:\\nThe cohesive experience contributed to a significant increase in customer satisfaction and a reduction in customer turnover.\\nOur technologies are designed to seamlessly integrate with your existing systems, minimizing disruption and maximizing productivity.\\nFollow Us on\\nEmail\\nGo\\nFacebook Icon\\nTwitter Icon\\nLinkedIn Icon\\nYoutube Icon\\nQuick Links\\nHome\\nServices\\nIndustries\\nSky Success\\nAbout Us\\nCareers\\nContact Us\\nOther Links\\nSky Leadership\\nPartners\\nLatest News\\nContract Vehicles\\nCapability Statement\\nLegal\\nData Privacy\\nTerms of Use\\nContact Us\\nCopyright © 2024 Sky Solutions.

One such initiative we participated in was the 2024 TSASP Institute Conference.\\nThe Tribal Sexual Assault Services Program (TSASP), established under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) of 2005, is the first federal funding initiative exclusively dedicated to providing culturally relevant services tailored to the unique needs of sexual assault victims in tribal communities. This program ensures survivors have access to resources that honor their cultural contexts and experiences.\\nAnil Boinapalli, Founder and CEO of Sky Solutions, shared his reflections after attending the 2024 Tribal Sexual Assault Services Program Institute: Empowerment Through Advocacy. Alongside colleagues Ericka Law and Eulana Williams, Anil emphasized Sky Solutions’ commitment to supporting the Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) and its mission. Drawing from his experiences growing up in a rural Indian village, Anil highlighted parallels between the systemic barriers faced by women in underserved communities globally and those in rural and tribal areas across the U.S.\\nAnil stressed the importance of addressing the digital divide, which goes beyond just access to technology, encompassing usability and inclusivity. Sky Solutions is committed to creating 508-compliant, accessible digital solutions designed to meet the needs of underserved populations, including those in poverty, rural communities, and individuals with disabilities. Anil called for greater collaboration between government and industry leaders to develop government services that are not only advanced but also inclusive and impactful.\\nAs a father, husband, and advocate for rural communities, Anil urged collective action to bridge the digital divide and ensure technology serves everyone, turning the insights from events like the OVW Institute into meaningful change.\\nAt Sky Solutions, bridging the digital divide is not just about technology—it’s about ensuring inclusivity, accessibility, and equity for all, especially those in rural and tribal areas. Together with our partners and government agencies, we are committed to creating impactful digital solutions that truly make a difference.\\nRelated Posts\\nInside Sky Solutions: The Story Behind Our Brand\\nDecember 19, 2024\\nExplore More\\nLeadership Summit 2024\\nDecember 17, 2024\\nExplore More\\nAnil Boinapalli Named a Finalist in the 22nd Annual GovCon Awards\\nNovember 7, 2024\\nExplore More\\nOur technologies are designed to seamlessly integrate with your existing systems, minimizing disruption and maximizing productivity.\\nFollow Us on\\nEmail\\nGo\\nFacebook Icon\\nTwitter Icon\\nLinkedIn Icon\\nYoutube Icon\\nQuick Links\\nHome\\nServices\\nIndustries\\nSky Success\\nAbout Us\\nCareers\\nContact Us\\nOther Links\\nSky Leadership\\nPartners\\nLatest News\\nContract Vehicles\\nCapability Statement\\nLegal\\nData Privacy\\nTerms of Use\\nContact Us\\nCopyright © 2024 Sky Solutions.

The work focuses on United States Core Data for Interoperability Plus (USCDI+).\\nUSCDI+ is a service ONC provides to federal and industry partners to establish, harmonize, and advance the use of interoperable data element lists that extend beyond the core data in the USCDI to meet specific programmatic and/or use case requirements.\\nIt began with a common goal of digital transformation\\nONC launched the USCDI+ initiative in October 2021, to support the identification and establishment of domain or program-specific datasets that will operate as extensions to the existing\\nUSCDI.\\nUSCDI+ efforts for data set development for quality measurements and public health began with CMS and CDC, with additional partners continuing to join the effort.\\nThrough Sky Solutions’ evaluation of requirements for USCDI+, our recommendation of the ServiceNow platform to build and maintain the data sets was selected as the right fit for workflow, reporting, and the service portal capabilities.\\nRapid release deployment\\nONC and Sky Solutions formed a dynamic team of industry experts in Health IT and ServiceNow to build the platform to support initial rollout of the public health domain data. We identified the ‘art of the possible’ and delivered on a 4-month timeline, inception-to-live build.\\n“We are honored to have been chosen by ONC for the USCDI+ collaboration tool platform as the agency aims to better serve its federal partners” said Slava Katz, Sky Solutions Executive Vice President and Health IT thought leader. “The ServiceNow platform paired with the capabilities of the App Engine and the Service Portal is a winning combination for the requirements of USCDI+.”\\nRobust features to accommodate interoperability needs\\nThe USCDI+ application was built on ServiceNow Service Portal and is available at\\nhttps://uscdiplus.healthit.gov/\\nWe focused on delivering the following core features using the\\nServiceNow platform\\n:\\nConfigure the review\\nworkflows\\n& enable a\\nuser interface\\nfor data element submissions.\\nDesign the\\nService Portal\\nfor the public end-user to view USCDI+ dataset.\\xa0 Contributors to the data sets have a login to submit domain specific data.\\xa0 Reviewers within ONC administer the information.\\nTailor the ServiceNow\\nunified data model\\nto support the relationships between USCDI+ data class, elements & use cases.\\nUse the\\ndata catalog\\nto maintain the records with useful dashboards for program management.\\nUsers also have submission access and the ability to comment on data elements, classes, & use cases.\\nUSCDI+ plan for the future\\nSky is supporting a standards-based approach to ensure data collected from electronic health records or other health IT systems is interoperable and ready for exchange with other entities.\\nAs we proceed in agile sprints accompanied by Jira and Confluence project support, we are using ServiceNow to create and harmonize the datasets developed as part of the USCDI+ process.\\xa0 These datasets will eventually be shared with relevant standards development organizations (SDOs) to develop implementation guides for pilot in the industry.\\nWhy Sky Solutions\\nSky Solutions, an 8a certified small-disadvantaged business, has served as a catalyst for digital transformation for federal healthcare agencies, state Medicaid agencies, and commercial health insurance payers. We are a ServiceNow Premier partner, providing service provider hosting administration as well as consultative services.\\nA cornerstone of Sky Solutions’ capabilities, and one that underpins our healthcare modernization initiatives, is our expertise with human-centered design as a tool to understand what users need.\\nSky Solutions is a Digital-First enablement partner that believes in using a human-centered approach to address the most complex and rapidly evolving business process challenges facing public, healthcare, life sciences, and financial services clients.

They required workspace portals for case managers and case workers to support the multiple roles involved throughout the HCBS program lifecycle, from enrollment to disenrollment. These portals were designed to enable efficient management of diverse case types while adhering to established business processes.\\nGoal\\nThe primary goal was to modernize four Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) Waiver programs, improve case management processes for handling diverse case types, and streamline eligibility determinations and service authorizations while providing real-time visibility into compliance and service delivery. Given the involvement of multiple agencies providing waiver services, the project also focused on generating detailed reports to support case managers and workers in maintaining effective communication within the system. Ultimately, the objective was to enhance access to essential Medicaid services for vulnerable populations across the state, ensuring they receive timely and efficient support.\\nChallenge\\nDuring the modernization of four Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) Waiver programs, several challenges were encountered, particularly in transitioning from the legacy system to the new platform. This process involved not only transferring data but also migrating attachments—a critical yet often-overlooked task—requiring meticulous planning to ensure seamless integration.\\nAdditionally, integrating with multiple subsystems within the PRISM environment posed significant difficulties. Each subsystem had unique data requirements and protocols, which complicated the process of retrieving and synchronizing the necessary information. Addressing these complexities required extensive collaboration and rigorous testing to ensure accurate and efficient data flow across all systems.\\nDespite these hurdles, the team remained steadfast in delivering a robust solution that enhanced overall service delivery for the HCBS programs.\\nSolutions\\nSky Solutions designed a comprehensive solution featuring dedicated workspace portals for case managers and case workers, streamlining collaboration and processes from enrollment to disenrollment. These portals supported the diverse roles of providers and state government users, enabling efficient management of various case types in line with established business processes.\\nThe solution enhanced tracking across multiple case management areas, including claims, complaints, appeals, prior authorizations, etc., while simplifying the prior authorization process within the HCBS programs. Recognizing the involvement of multiple agencies in providing waiver services, Sky Solutions developed detailed reports to aid case managers and workers in decision-making and communication.\\nKey highlights of the solution include:\\nLeveraging Pega to modernize four Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) Waiver programs\\nImplementing a centralized platform to streamline eligibility determinations, service authorizations, and case management\\nCreating dedicated workspace portals for providers and state government users to manage diverse case types effectively\\nEnsuring seamless integration with PRISM subsystems for real-time data access\\nProviding users with readily available, relevant information to improve efficiency\\nIncorporating robust tracking features to manage claims, complaints, appeals, etc.\\nEquipping case managers and workers with tools to enhance service delivery.\\nTechnologies/Methodologies\\nPega\\nFileNet\\nLow-Code/ No-Code\\nOutcome\\nSky Solutions has streamlined the Medicaid prior authorization process, cutting delays and boosting efficiency for members and providers. Member enrollment now takes less than 30 days, down from 5-6 months. Providers can now add or update member services within hours instead of three months. State users and providers now have real-time access to track and update waiver program stages via user-friendly online portals.\\nOur technologies are designed to seamlessly integrate with your existing systems, minimizing disruption and maximizing productivity.\\nFollow Us on\\nEmail\\nGo\\nFacebook Icon\\nTwitter Icon\\nLinkedIn Icon\\nYoutube Icon\\nQuick Links\\nHome\\nServices\\nIndustries\\nSky Success\\nAbout Us\\nCareers\\nContact Us\\nOther Links\\nSky Leadership\\nPartners\\nLatest News\\nContract Vehicles\\nCapability Statement\\nLegal\\nData Privacy\\nTerms of Use\\nContact Us\\nCopyright © 2024 Sky Solutions.
