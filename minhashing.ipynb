    "# **OrderFox Hackathon: Domain-Specific Chatbot Design** 🚀  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **📌 Overview**  \n",
    "In this hackathon, your goal is to design and implement a domain-specific chatbot using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. You will be provided with a **dataset of HTML-crawled documents** in jason format, and your task is to build a system that effectively retrieves relevant information and generates accurate responses.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **🔹 What You Need to Do**  \n",
    "1. **Set up your own environment** - A github Repository, or make a copy of this colab notebook, or a Kaggle notebook.\n",
    "2. **Load and Process Documents** – Extract text from the json files provided to you.\n",
    "3. **Implement Document Retrieval**\n",
    "– Try different retrieval approaches, including:  \n",
    "   - Keyword-based search  \n",
    "   - Vector embeddings (e.g. Bag-of-Words, Word2Vec, embedding models on Hugging Face, embeddig models provided with OpenAI API)  + vector database\n",
    "   - Graph / Tree extraction + graph database\n",
    "   - Hybrid methods   \n",
    "4. **Perform Response Generation** – Retrieve relevant documents and generate responses using a Language Model:\n",
    "  - Feel free to explore prompt engineer\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Optimize and Evaluate Your System** – Compare performance based on relevance, grounding, fluency, efficiency, and cost.  \n",
    "6. **Deliver a Well-Structured Solution** – Organize your code as a modular project repository.  \n",
    " - Code repository or notebook\n",
    " - Make sure to include your knowledge database\n",
    "\n",
    "## **📦 What Is Provided?**  \n",
    "✅ **Dataset**: JSON files containing extracted HTML content, available on a shared Google Drive and Kaggle.  \n",
    "✅ **Baseline Notebook**: A starter kit with useful tools and guidance.  \n",
    "✅ **Evaluation Metrics**: A structured evaluation framework to assess performance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **🖥️ What Computing Resources Can You Use?**  \n",
    "You are welcome to choose your preferred platform to develop your solution. Either   \n",
    "- Locally (on your own machine) 💻  \n",
    "- or Using **cloud platforms** such as **Google Colab** or **Kaggle** (a free account is sufficient).  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **🛠️ Tools You May Consider**  \n",
    "(*These are recommendations to help you get started. You are free to use alternative tools—just document your choices clearly!*)  \n",
    "- **Database**: FAISS, ChromaDB, SQLite, Elasticsearch, Neo4j and etc.  \n",
    "- **Embedding Models**: Hugging Face Sentence-Transformers, OpenAI Embeddings  \n",
    "- **LLM for Generation**: OpenAI: gpt-4o-mini\n",
    "- **Others**: Langchain, GraphRAG, and etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **📌 Final Delivery**  \n",
    "Your final submission should include:  \n",
    "✅ A well-documented **GitHub repository or notebook**  \n",
    "✅ A clear **README** explaining your approach  \n",
    "✅ A structured **retrieval and generation modules**  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **🔥 Bonus Points For**  \n",
    "✨ Innovative retrieval techniques  \n",
    "✨ Well-organized, modular code  \n",
    "✨ Creative visualizations or user interfaces  \n"
